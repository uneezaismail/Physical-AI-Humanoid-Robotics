## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

Generated `tasks.md` organized by user stories (Conceptual Mastery, Network Verification, First Cross-Device Code).
Tasks follow the checklist format `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`.
Identified dependencies (Foundational phase blocks user stories) and parallel opportunities.
Strategy: MVP first (Conceptual Mastery), then incremental delivery of labs.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Actionable task list generated.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: tasks.md created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implement tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: Clear path forward. Tasks are granular and specific.
